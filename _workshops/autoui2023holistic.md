abstract: "As the field of automated vehicles (AVs) advances, it has become increasingly critical to develop human-machine interfaces (HMI) for both internal and external communication. Critical dialogue is emerging around the potential necessity for a holistic approach to HMI unified and coherent experience for different stakeholders interacting with AVs. This workshop seeks to bring together designers, engineers, researchers, and other stakeholders to delve into relevant use cases, exploring the potential advantages and challenges of this approach. The insights generated from this workshop aim to inform further design and research in the development of coherent HMIs for AVs, ultimately for more seamless integration of AVs into existing traffic."

| Time | Activity  | Description   |
|---    |---    |---    |
| 09:00–09:15     | Welcome and introduction  | Ice-breaker activity, organisers give a brief introduction about the day and present the keynote speakers.     |
| 09:15–09:35     | Keynote speeches: Internal and external HMI   | Opening up the workshop with two special keynote speeches. We are happy to announce our renowned speakers:<br>Dr. Wendy Ju: "eHMI. Should your car talk to you?"<br>Dr. Andreas Löcken: "Internal HMI".    |
| 09:35–09:45     | Questions to keynote speakers     |   |
| 09:45–10:15    | Plenary: Reflective discussion    | Alongside our distinguished keynote speakers and engaged audience members, we will initiate a thoughtful dialogue. This discussion will revolve around a use-case scenario thoughtfully curated by the organizers. We'll delve into questions such as:<br>1. How would you define a holistic perspective?<br>2. What potential benefits can be derived from it?<br>3. What are the challenges it presents?<br>4. How should we strategically approach this perspective?.   |
| 10:15–10:30   | Coffee break  |   |
| 10:30–11:30   | Group work    | Participants will be divided into small groups, and further discuss and create new use scenarios using provided physicalisation tools*.<br><br>* In order to effectively support the discussion among participants from different backgrounds, we will conduct a deliberately designed collaborative activity known as participatory physicalisation (Huron et al. (2017), Jansen et al. (2015), Koningsbruggen et al. (2022)) . This activity employs detailed instructions and tangible artefacts to facilitate the exploration of ideas, physicalise the discussion process and lead to shared understandings (Panagiotidou et al. (2022) ).   |
| 11:30–11:45   | Coffee break  |   |
| 11:45–12:20   | Plenary: Sum-up discussion    |   |
| 12:20–12:30   | Closing   |   |

## Expected outcomes
This workshop will serve as a foundational exploration of HMI for AV design and research through a holistic lens, cultivating a shared understanding among participants from various backgrounds. The insights derived from our discussions, particularly regarding use cases and validity arguments for this holistic approach, will be compiled in a summary report. We intend to disseminate these findings through an academic article, marking the first consensus among experts in the field.

## Call for participants
Our target participants include designers, engineers, and researchers with expertise in automotive HMI design and development, encompassing both in-vehicle and external interfaces. Additionally, we welcome individuals with other profiles, including urban planners, traffic policymakers, etc., to promote interdisciplinary collaboration.
