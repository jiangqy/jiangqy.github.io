Welcome to my personal homepage! 

My name is Qing-Yuan Jiang (蒋庆远 in Chinese). I am an Associate Professor at <a href="https://cs.njust.edu.cn/" target="_blank">the School of Compute Science and Engineering</a>, <a href="https://www.njust.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Nanjing University of Science and Technology</a>. I am a member of <a href="http://www.njustkmg.cn/" target="_blank">the Knowledge Mining Group</a> leading by Prof. Yang Yang.

I received my B.Sc. degree from the <a href="https://cs.nju.edu.cn/" _target="_blank">Department of Computer Science and Technology</a>, <a href="https://www.nju.edu.cn/" _target="_blank">Nanjing University</a> in 2014. I received my PhD degree from the <a href="https://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn/CH.MainPage.ashx" target="_blan">LAMDA group</a>, <a href="https://cs.nju.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Department of Computer Science and Technology</a>, <a href="https://www.nju.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Nanjing University</a> in 2020, under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://cs.nju.edu.cn/lwj" target="_blank">Wu-Jun Li</a>. PhD thesis: Discrete Hashing Learning [<a href="https://jiangqy.github.io/publications/assert/PHD_thesis.pdf" target="_blank">pdf</a>].

After graduated from Nanjing University, I was an algorithm researcher at <a href="https://www.huawei.com/cn/" _target="_blank">HuaWei</a> from 2020 to 2024, as a member of Huawei's <a href="https://career.huawei.com/reccampportal/portal5/topminds.html" _target="_blank">top minds project</a> (华为天才少年计划). At Huawei, my work focused on multimodal search (Petal Search) and multimodal large language models (<a href="https://www.huaweicloud.com/product/pangu.html" target="_blank">Pangu MLLM</a>).

In 2024, I joined <a href="https://cs.njust.edu.cn/" target="_blank">the School of Compute Science and Engineering</a>, <a href="https://www.njust.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Nanjing University of Science and Technology</a>, as an associate professor. My research interests are multimodal learning, multimodal large language models, information retrieval. 

Welcome students who are interested in applying for postdoctoral positions, pursuing Ph.D. or Master's degrees, as well as undergraduates who wish to participate in scientific research training or complete their graduation thesis to join <a href="http://www.njustkmg.cn/" target="_blank">our group</a>. Please contact <a href="mailto:yyang@njust.edu.cn">Prof. Yang Yang</a>, Prof. <a href="mailto:wlguo@njust.edu.cn">Prof. Wei Li Guo</a>, or Prof. <a href="mailto:jiangqy@njust.edu.cn">Prof. Qing-Yuan Jiang</a> via email.
