#### Introduction
The course Data Analytics for Engineers is a mandatory generic engineering course offered to all first-year bachelor students at TU/e in Q3. It attracts more than 1000 students. It is organised with the involvement of staff from a number of departments of TU/e.

#### My role
- 2022–: supervisor.

#### Learning goals
- **L1**. Students gain insight in basic techniques for processing large amounts of data in an efficient, reliable, and consistent way.
- **L2**. Students develop skills in understanding, interpreting, and documenting data and information in the context of realistic scenarios. 
- **L3**. Students get understanding of the data life cycle and develop skills for structuring their solutions of practical problems along the phases of the data life cycle. 
- **L4**. Students apply data analytics techniques to realistic data sets in which they can recognize the demands within their area of specialization. 
- **L5**. Students obtain basic knowledge of statistical concepts and techniques and develop skills to apply them in practice. 
- **L6**. Students learn to implement their solutions for data analytics problems in a programming language (Python), and apply a structured and systematic approach to data processing.

#### Students learn
- To use basic statistical concepts and techniques (like the mean, median, mode, percentile, range, variance, confidence intervals, p-value, correlation, and t-test).
- To read database schemes and write simple queries to a data base in SQL.
- To clean data (missing values, duplicates, and outlier detection).
- To choose and apply data transformations (normalization, aggregation), data reduction, and data discretion. 
- To choose and apply suitable visualization techniques (like line graphs, bar charts, scatter plots, pie charts, box plots, violin plots, and heat maps).
- To analyse and model data (linear regression, clustering, decision tree mining, association rules learning).
- To choose and communicate interesting findings in the language understandable for their end user (visually or textually). 
- To use tools for implementing data engineering tasks (Excel in week 1, and Python with Jupiter Notebooks during the rest of the course). 
- To implement their solutions in Python using a structured approach to programming. 
- Students will also learn to estimate the consequences of choices made for the other phases of data processing. The interpretation of results is considered in every phase of the analysis.

#### Course setup
- One lecture of two hours per week during 7 weeks. 
- Online homework, including self-study based on screencasts and tutorials and exercises in OnCourse (part of graded homework). 
- Two practicum sessions of two hours per week during 7 weeks. 

#### Grading
- Written exam – 50% of the final grade.
- Two graded assignments – 20% of the final grade per assignment. Students work on realistic data analytics problems.
- Online exercises – 10% of the final grade.
