abstract: "This paper summarizes our results from survey research and driving simulator experiments on auditory, vibrotactile, and visual take-over requests in highly automated driving. Our review shows that vibrotactile takeover requests in the driverâ€™s seat yielded relatively high ratings of self-reported usefulness and satisfaction. Auditory take-over requests in the form of beeping sound were regarded as useful but not satisfactory, and it was found that the beep rate corresponds to perceived urgency. Visual-only feedback (LEDs) was regarded by participants as neither useful nor satisfactory. Augmented visual feedback was found to support effective steering and braking actions, and may be a useful compliment to vibrotactile take-over requests. The present findings may be used in the design of take-over requests."
