abstract: "Driving simulators are regarded as valuable tools for human factors research on automated driving and traffic safety. However, simulators that enable the study of human-human interactions are rare. In this study, we present an open-source coupled simulator developed in Unity. The simulator supports input from head-mounted displays, motion suits, and game controllers. It facilitates research on interactions between pedestrians and humans inside manual and automated vehicles. We present results of a demo experiment on the interaction between a passenger in an automated car equipped with an external human-machine interface, a driver of a manual car, and a pedestrian. We conclude that the newly developed open-source coupled simulator is a promising tool for future human factors research."
