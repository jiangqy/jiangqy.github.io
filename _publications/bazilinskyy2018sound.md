abstract: "The automotive industry is recognised as a challenging arena for sound design, because the presented information needs to not only comply with safety regulations but also match subjective expectations. By means of a structured interview with ten employees (software developers, quality analysists, sound designers, engineers, managers) of the company Continental, we collected requirements for the sound design process in an automotive industry setting. We present a sound design process consisting of three stages: description, design/creation, and verification. We developed a prototype of a web-based application to support the process."
