abstract: "In urban environments, cycling is an important method of transportation due to being sustainable, healthy and less space-intensive than motorised traffic. Most literature on interactions between automated vehicles (AVs) and vulnerable road users (VRUs) focuses on external Human-Machine Interfaces positioned on AVs and telling VRUs what to do. Such an interface requires cyclists to actively look for and interpret the information and can reduce their ability to make their own decisions. We designed a physical bicycle-to-vehicle (B2V) interaction that allows cyclists to share the intention to turn with AVs through vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication. We explored four concepts of interaction with hands, feet, hips, and knees. The final concept uses haptic feedback in each handle. The test with nine participants explored the clarity of the feedback and compared two variations: (1) providing feedback in the beginning, during and at the end and (2) giving feedback only at the beginning and end. Results indicate that the general meaning of both variants is clear and that the preferred variation of feedback is up to personal preference. We suggest that B2V interactions should be possible to personalise."
