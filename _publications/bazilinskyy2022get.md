abstract: "Past research suggests that displays on the exterior of the car, known as eHMIs, can be effective in helping pedestrians to make safe crossing decisions. This study examines a new application of eHMIs, namely the provision of directional information in scenarios where the pedestrian is almost hit by a car. In an experiment using a head-mounted display and a motion suit, participants had to cross the road while a car driven by another participant approached them. The results showed that the directional eHMI caused pedestrians to step back compared to no eHMI. The eHMI increased the pedestrians’ self-reported understanding of the car’s intention, although some pedestrians did not notice the eHMI. In conclusion, there may be potential for supporting pedestrians in situations where they need support the most, namely critical encounters. Future research may consider coupling a directional eHMI to autonomous emergency steering."
