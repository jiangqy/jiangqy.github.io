abstract: "Head-mounted displays (HMDs) offer immersion and binocular disparity. This study investigated whether an HMD yields better object-alignment performance than a conventional monitor in virtual environments that are rich in pictorial depth cues. To determine the effects of immersion and disparity separately, three hardware setups were compared: (1) a conventional computer monitor, yielding low immersion, (2) an HMD with binocular-vision settings (HMD stereo), and (3) an HMD with the same image presented to both eyes (HMD mono). Two virtual environments were used: a street environment in which two cars had to be aligned (target distance of about 15 m) and an office environment in which two books had to be aligned (target distance of about 0.7 m, at which binocular depth cues were expected to be important). Twenty males (mean age = 21.2, SD age = 1.6) each completed 10 object-alignment trials for each of the six conditions. The results revealed no statistically significant differences in object-alignment performance between the three hardware setups. A self-report questionnaire showed that participants felt more involved in the virtual environment and experienced more oculomotor discomfort with the HMD than with the monitor."
