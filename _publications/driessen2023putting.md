abstract: "In late September 2023, OpenAI launched the much-anticipated image-to-text capabilities ofChatGPT, also referred to as GPT-4V. To date, there are few formal evaluations of GPT-4Vavailable. In this study, we applied GPT-4V to forward-facing traffic images, where GPT-4V was prompted to arrange these images in terms of risk to the driver. A total of 210 images were ranked from low to high risk, and the correlation coefficient was determined with human ratings of the same images as established in a previous study. Across the 210 images, GPT-4Vshowed a strong zero-order correlation with the human risk ratings (r = 0.69). Combined with traditional computer vision features (number of detected individuals in the traffic image, average size of bounding boxes) as well as the current speed of the vehicle, the predictive value was r =0.79. The current results suggest that GPT-4V output adds predictive value by incorporating context, something traditional computer vision methods do not incorporate. It is expected that powerful applications, such as real-time feedback systems, will become feasible if the inference time of large language models is reduced from multiple seconds to a sub-second level."
