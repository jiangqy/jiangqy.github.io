abstract: "The increase of smartphones over the past decade has contributed to distraction in traffic. However, smartphones could potentially be turned into an advantage by being able to detect whether a motorized vehicle is passing the smartphone user (e.g., a pedestrian or cyclist). Herein, we present a dataset of audio recordings of passing vehicles, made with a smartphone. Recordings were made of a passing passenger car and a scooter in various conditions (windy weather vs. calm weather, approaching from the front vs. from behind, 1 m, 2 m, and 3 m distance between smartphone and vehicle, vehicle driving with 30 vs. 50 km/h, and smartphone being stationary vs. moving with the cyclist). Data from an 8-microphone array, video recordings, and GPS data of vehicle position and speed are provided as well. Our present dataset may prove useful in the development of mobile apps that detect a passing motorized vehicle, or for transportation research."
